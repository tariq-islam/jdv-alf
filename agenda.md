0. Start with "where we are and what we want to do"

1. A look at what JDV enables that traditional tools make difficult
    Answering why this tool, and why current state of data integration, DaaS sucks

2. slide 8 How can this be used (of Yasir's deck?)
2.1 Federated real time view of data (in addition to PCS)
Migrations / Modernization (proprietary, mainframes abstraction), PCS / Agile BI and Analytics, microservices enablement

3. Architectural overview

4. Address performance concerns
    Get good with this, educate folks on why JDV and negligible overhead
